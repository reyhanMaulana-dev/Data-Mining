# Data Mining

Welcome to the **Data Mining** repository! This repository contains various study cases related to Data Mining, aimed at enhancing understanding through practical examples and exercises.

## Introduction
This repository is a collection of study cases focusing on different aspects of Data Mining, from data preprocessing to the implementation of popular algorithms. Each study case provides hands-on experience and allows users to apply techniques to real-world datasets, improving practical data mining skills.

## Study Cases
The repository covers the following study cases:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outlier detection, data transformation, and scaling.
- **Classification Algorithms**: Study cases on Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Clustering**: Implementing and analyzing k-Means and Agglomerative Clustering on various datasets.
- **Association Rule Learning**: Understanding market basket analysis using the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying outliers with Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF).
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applying PCA and t-SNE for feature reduction and visualization.

Each study case is accompanied by detailed explanations, code, and results, allowing for a deep dive into each topic.

## Tools and Libraries
